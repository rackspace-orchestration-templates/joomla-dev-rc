  Joomla is a flexible content management system, written in PHP, that allows
  for the creation of powerful web applications and sites.
instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to Joomla, the [Beginner Tutorials](https://docs.joomla.org/Beginner_Tutorials)
  documentation will step you through the process of logging into the admin
  panel, customizing your blog, and changing your theme.

  After the stack has been created, you can find the admin username and
  password listed in the "Credentials" section of Stack Details.

  #### Accessing Your Deployment
  If you provided a domain name that is associated with your Rackspace Cloud
  account and chose to create DNS records, you should be able to navigate to
  the provided domain name in your browser. If DNS has not been configured yet,
  please refer to this
  [documentation](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
  on how to setup your hosts file to allow your browser to access your
  deployment via domain name. Please note: some applications like WordPress,
  Drupal, Joomla, and Magento may not work properly unless accessed via domain name.
  DNS should point to the IP address of the Load Balancer.

  #### Migrating an Existing Site
  If you'd like to move your existing site to this deployment, there is a
  tutorial available [here](https://docs.joomla.org/Copying_a_Joomla_website).

  #### Extensions
  There are over 23,000 plugins that have been created by an engaged developer
  community. The [Extensions directory](http://extensions.joomla.org/)
  provides an easy way to discover popular extensions that other users have found
  to be helpful. Please note that adding plugins can negatively impact the
  performance of your site.

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/).
  Once the stack has been deployed, Ansible will not run again unless you update the
  stack. **Any changes made to the configuration may be overwritten when the stack
  is updated.**

  Joomla was downloaded directly from [joomla.org](http://joomla.org/). Joomla
  is installed in /var/www/vhosts/YOUR DOMAIN/httpdocs and served by [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).
  The nginx configuration file will be named using the domain name used as a
  part of this deployment (for example, domain.com.conf).

  Because this stack is intended for lower-traffic deployments, there is no
  caching configured.

  MySQL is being hosted locally, using MySQL.
  Backups for MySQL are provided by [Holland](http://wiki.hollandbackup.org/),
  which is running on the Master server.

  Backups are configured using Cloud Backups.  The server is configured
  to back up /var/spool/holland and /var/www once per week, and to retain
  these backups for 30 days.

  In order to restore the Database from backup, you will need to first restore
  /var/spool/holland from the appropriate Cloud Backup.  After you have done so,
  you will need to log into the server and restore the Holland backup via the
  MySQL client.  For more assistance, please contact your Support team.

  Monitoring is configured to verify that nginx is running.  Additionally, the
  default CPU, RAM, and Filesystem checks are in place on the server.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided with this deployment can be used to log in as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
  This key can be used to log into this server.

  #### Additional Notes
  This stack will not ensure that Joomla or the servers themselves are
  up-to-date.  You are responsible for ensuring that all software is
  updated.

  #### Development - RCv3
  This stack is running the latest version of
  [Joomla](http://joomla.org/),
  [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/),
  and [PHP FPM](http://php-fpm.org/).
  with a Cloud Database running
  [MySQL 5.1](http://www.mysql.com/about/).

  **This deployment is meant for development and testing scenarios only and is not
  intended for production use**.

  This template will only function with RackConnect v3.
